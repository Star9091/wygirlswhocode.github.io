  <h1>Welcome to my Profile!</h1>
  <p> Hi! My name is Emily, and I am a member of the Girls Who Code Club at Whitney M. Young!<br><br> Here's a few things about me!</p> <br>
<dl>
    <dt>Hello from a Videogamer!</dt>
    <dd> I mainly play Nintendo games, you'll likely see me playing with my 3DS. I really want to get into PC gaming, though with my years with controllers, so it makes things a bit harder...</dd><br>
    <dt>Drawing and Writing Creativity!</dt>
    <dd>I do a bit of doodling and coloring at school, in hopes my teachers don't notice I'm doing so. I also do a bit of writing, though I don't do that much. People had told me that I do a nice job at drawing and writing, so I put it on here.</dd><br>
    <dt>I can Code!</dt>
    <dd>I can code in Python and HTML5 and CSS. I'm currently learning how to write in JavaScript and, in general, code faster than I'm currently doing so right now.</dd>
</dl><br>
<p>So, that's all about me and how I live my life... So I hope you enjoy looking through our profiles at the Whitney M. Young Girls Who Code Club! In the meanwhile: enjoy your day!</p><br>
