      <h2>Cool Codeday Opportunity! (2/18-2/19)</h2>
      <p>Codeday is an overnight hackathon with awards where you learn to code games and apps. No experience is necessary! There is a small fee of $10, but that includes food for the 24 hours! It sounds like a lot of fun and will take place 2/18 - 2/19 at the Blue 1647 Innovation Center. More info: https://codeday.org/chicago</p>

      <h2>Raspberry Pi Challenge 2017!</h2>
